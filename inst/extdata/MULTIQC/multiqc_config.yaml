    fastqc_per_base_sequence_quality: "The **Per base sequence quality** plot gives an overview of the range of quality scores across all bases at each position in the FastQ file.  The per-base sequence quality is determined by the Phred score.  The Phred score is calculated on a log 10 scale such that, if a base has a quality score of 10, there is a 1 in 10 chance it is wrong, and if it has a Phred score of 30, it has a 1 in 1000 chance of being wrong.  Thus, the higher the Phred score, the more reliable the base call.  The colour palette is divided into very good quality calls (green), calls of reasonable quality (orange), and calls of poor quality (red). The quality of calls on most platforms will degrade as the run progresses, so it is common to see base calls falling into the orange area towards the end of a read."
    fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores: "The **Per sequence quality scores** plot shows the frequencies of quality scores in a sample and identifies whether a subset of sequences have universally low quality values. It is not unusual for some sequences to be poorly imaged (for example, if they are on the edge of the field of view), but  these should represent only a small percentage of the total sequences.  If a significant proportion of the sequences in a run have an overall low quality then this could indicate a systematic problem that needs addressing."
    fastqc_per_base_sequence_content: "The **Per base sequence content** displays the per-base nucleotide frequencies at each position along the reads.  The heatmap shwos a composite colour at each position along the read, with A, C, G, and T, being represented by green, blue, black and red, respectively.  Since the reads are random fragments, it is expected that the contribution of A and T, and C and G should be similar at each position.  In reality, this is often not the case for the first positions.   Libraries produced by random hexamer priming almost always show a bias in the first positions of the reads.  This bias is not due to a single sequence, but results from enrichement of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads (this usually has very little effect on downstream analysis).  Nearly all RNA-Seq libraries will fail this module because of this bias."
    fastqc_per_sequence_gc_content: "The **Per sequence GC content** plot displays the GC content across the whole length of each sequence in the library. For a normal random library a roughly normal distribution of GC content is expected.  The peak should correspond to the overall GC content of the underlying genome. An unusually shaped distribution may indicate a contaminated library or the presence of a biased subset of sequences (e.g. promoters, CpG islands)."
    fastqc_sequence_duplication_levels: "In a diverse library most sequences will occur only once in the final set. A low level of duplication may indicate a very high level of coverage of the target sequence, but a high level of duplication is more likely to indicate some kind of enrichment bias (e.g., PCR over-amplification).  The **Sequence duplication levels** module counts the degree of duplication of every sequence in the library.  This is used to create a plot showing the relative number of sequences with different degrees of duplication. In RNA-seq data, duplication levels can reach upto 40%. Generally, these duplicates should not be removed as it is difficult to determine whether they represent PCR duplicates or high expression of certain genes."
    fastqc_overrepresented_sequences: "The **Overrepresented sequences** section identifies the highly duplicated sequences that have been detected by the sequence duplication module.  Finding that a single sequence is very overrepresented in the set either means that it is highly biologically significant, or indicates that the library is contaminated, or not as diverse as expected"
    fastqc_adapter_content: "The **Adapter content** module checks the presence of some common read-through adapter sequences, and allows an assessment of whether the library will benefit from adapter trimming. The plot shows a cumulative percentage count of the proportion of adapter sequences at each position, and thus as the read length progresses, the overall proportion will continue to increase."
