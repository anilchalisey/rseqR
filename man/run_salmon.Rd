\usage{
run_salmon(
  fastq1,
  fastq2 = NULL,
  index.dir,
  dest.dir = "SALMON",
  salmon = "salmon",
  threads = NULL,
  advanced.opts = NULL,
  bam = FALSE,
  bootstraps = 0,
  seqBias = TRUE,
  gcBias = TRUE,
  posBias = FALSE,
  allowOrphans = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastq1}{a character vector indicating the read files to be trimmed.}

\item{fastq2}{(optional) a character vector indicating read files to be
trimmmed.  If specified, it is assumed the reads are paired, and this vector
MUST be in the same order as those listed in \code{fastq1}.  If \code{NULL}
then it is assumed the reads are single-end.}

\item{index.dir}{directory of the index files needed for read mapping using Salmon.
See function \code{'build_index()'}.}

\item{dest.dir}{directory where results are to be saved.  If directory does not exist,
then it will be created.}

\item{salmon}{(optional) string giving full command to use to call
Salmon, if simply typing "salmon" at the command line does not give the
required version of Salmon or does not work. Default is simply "salmon".
If used, this argument should give the full path to the desired Salmon
binary.}

\item{threads}{an integer value indicating the number of parallel threads to
be used by FastQC. [DEFAULT = maximum number of available threads - 1].}

\item{advanced.opts}{character vector supplying list of advanced option
arguments to apply to each Salmon call. For details see Salmon documentation
or type \code{salmon quant --help-reads} at the command line.}

\item{bam}{logical, if \code{TRUE} then create a pseudo-alignment BAM file.
[Default = \code{FALSE}]}

\item{bootstraps}{integer giving the number of bootstrap samples
that Salmon should use (default is 0). With bootstrap samples, uncertainty
in abundance can be quantified.}

\item{seqBias}{logical, should Salmon's option be used to model and correct
abundances for sequence specific bias? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{gcBias}{logical, should Salmon's option be used to model and correct
abundances for GC content bias? Requires Salmon version 0.7.2 or higher.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{posBias}{logical, should Salmon's option be used to model and correct
abundances for positional biases? Requires Salmon version 0.7.3 or higher.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{allowOrphans}{logical, if \code{TRUE} then consider orphaned reads as
valid hits when performing lightweight-alignment. This option will increase
sensitivity (allow more reads to map and more transcripts to be detected), but may
decrease specificity as orphaned alignments are more likely to be spurious.
For more details see Salmon documentation.}
}
\value{
The following items will be returned and saved in the salmon directory:
\enumerate{
\item quant.sf: plain-text, tab-separated quantification file
that contains 5 column: Name,Length,EffectiveLength,TPM, and NumReads.
\item quant.sf.bkp: plain-text, tab-separated quantification file
that contains 5 column: Name,Length,EffectiveLength,TPM, and NumReads.
This is the raw version of the quant.sf file.
\item cmd_info.json: A JSON format file that records the main command
line parameters with which Salmon was invoked for the run that produced
the output in this directory.
\item aux_info: This directory will have a number of files (and
subfolders) depending on how salmon was invoked.
\item meta_info.json: A JSON file that contains meta information about
the run, including stats such as the number of observed and mapped
fragments, details of the bias modeling etc.
\item ambig_info.tsv: This file contains information about the number
of uniquely-mapping reads as well as the total number of
ambiguously-mapping reads for each transcript.
\item lib_format_counts.json: This JSON file reports the number of
fragments that had at least one mapping compatible with the designated
library format, as well as the number that didn't.
\item libParams: The auxiliary directory will contain a text file
called flenDist.txt. This file contains an approximation of the
observed fragment length distribution.

\description{
Run the abundance quantification tool \code{Salmon} on a set of FASTQ
files. Requires \code{Salmon} (\url{https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/})
to be installed and a Salmon transcript index must have been generated prior
to using this function. See the Salmon website for installation and basic
usage instructions.
