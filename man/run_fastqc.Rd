run_fastqc(
  fastqc.files = NULL,
  dest.dir = "FASTQC",
  threads = NULL,
  fastqc = "fastqc"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastqc.files}{character vector of paths to fastq files. [DEFAULT = NULL].}

\item{dest.dir}{character string indicating directory to save results. [DEFAULT = "FASTQC"]}

\item{threads}{an integer value indicating the number of parallel threads to
be used by FastQC. [DEFAULT = maximum number of available threads - 1].}

\item{fastqc}{a character string specifying the path to the fastqc executable.
[DEFAULT = "fastqc"].}
}
\value{
\code{character} string specifying the path of the output directory.
}
\description{
Run the FastQC tool to generate HTML reports. FastQC may be installed from

}
\section{FastQC path}{

If the executable is in \code{$PATH}, then the default value for paths
(\code{"fastqc"}) will work. If it is not in \code{$PATH}, then the absolute
path should be given. If using Windows 10, it is assumed that FASTQC has
been installed in WSL, and the same rules apply.

\dontrun{
fqFiles <- list.files(path = "fastqDir", pattern = "*.fastq", full.names = TRUE)
