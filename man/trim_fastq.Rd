\arguments{
\item{fastq1}{a character vector indicating the read files to be trimmed.}

\item{fastq2}{(optional) a character vector indicating read files to be
trimmmed.  If specified, it is assumed the reads are paired, and this vector
MUST be in the same order as those listed in \code{fastq1}.  If \code{NULL}
then it is assumed the reads are single-end.}

\item{adapter1}{a character string specifying the adapter sequence to be
trimmed. If not specified explicitly, Trim Galore will try to auto-detect
whether the Illumina universal, Nextera transposase or Illumina small RNA
adapter sequence was used. Also see \code{illumina}, \code{nextera} and
\code{small_rna} options. If no adapter can be detected within the first 1
million sequences of the first file specified Trim Galore defaults to
\code{illumina}.}

\item{adapter2}{a character string specifying an optional adapter sequence to
be trimmed off read 2 of paired-end files. This option requires paired-end
reads.}

\item{illumina}{a logical specifying that the adapter sequence to be trimmed
is the first 13bp of the Illumina universal adapter AGATCGGAAGAGC instead of
the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.  Default: \code{FALSE}}

\item{nextera}{adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 12bp of the
Nextera adapter CTGTCTCTTATA instead of the default auto-detection of adapter
sequence.}

\item{small_rna}{a logical specifying that the adapter sequence to be trimmed
is the first 12bp of the Illumina Small RNA 3' Adapter TGGAATTCTCGG instead
of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.  Selecting to trim
smallRNA adapters will also lower the \code{length} value to 18bp. If the
smallRNA libraries are paired-end then \code{adapter2} will be set to the
Illumina small RNA 5' adapter automatically (GATCGTCGGACT) unless
\code{adapter2} had been defined explicitly.}

\item{minlength}{an integer value; reads that become shorter than this length
as a result of either quality or adapter trimming are discarded. A value of 0
effectively disables this behaviour.  Default: 20 bp.  For paired-end files,
both reads of a read-pair need to be longer than bp to be printed out to
validated paired-end files. If only one read became too short there is the
possibility of keeping such unpaired single-end reads (see
\code{retain_unpaired}). Default pair-cutoff: 20 bp.}

\item{minqual}{an integer value specifying the quality threshold below which
to trim low-quality ends from reads in addition to adapter removal. Default
Phred score: 20.}

\item{trimN}{a logical specifying whether to remove Ns from the end of reads.}

\item{retainUnpaired}{a logical.  If only one of the two paired-end reads
become too short, the longer read will be written to either .unpaired_1.fq or
.unpaired_2.fq output files. The length cutoff for unpaired single-end reads
is governed by the parameters \code{retain1length} and \code{retain2length}.
Default: ON.}

\item{retain1length}{an integer.  Unpaired single-end read length cutoff
needed for read 1 to be written to .unpaired_1.fq output file. These reads
may then be mapped in single-end mode. Default: 35 bp.}

\item{retain2length}{an integer.  Unpaired single-end read length cutoff
needed for read 2 to be written to .unpaired_1.fq output file. These reads
may then be mapped in single-end mode. Default: 35 bp}

\item{clipR1}{an integer instructing Trim Galore to remove the specified
number of bp from the 5' end of read 1 (or single-end reads). This may be
useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some sort of unwanted
bias at the 5' end. Default: 0}

\item{clipR2}{an integer instructing Trim Galore to remove the specified
number of bp from the 5' end of read 2 (paired-end reads only). This may be
useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some sort of unwanted
bias at the 5' end. Default: 0}

\item{clip3primeR1}{an integer instructing Trim Galore to remove the
specified number of bp from the 3' end of read 1 (or single-end reads) AFTER
adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some unwanted
bias from the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or
basecall quality. Default: 0.}

\item{clip3primeR2}{an integer instructing Trim Galore to remove the
specified number of bp from the 3' end of read 1 (or single-end reads) AFTER
adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some unwanted
bias from the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or
basecall quality. Default: 0.}

\item{robust_check}{a logical indicating whether to check that the paired
files specified are matching and have equal numbers of reads.  Default:
\code{FALSE}}

\item{dest.dir}{a character string specifying the output directory.  If NULL
a directory named "TRIMMED_FASTQC" is created in the current working directory
[DEFAULT = NULL].}

\item{threads}{an integer value indicating the number of parallel threads to
be used by FastQC. [DEFAULT = maximum number of available threads - 1].}

\item{multi.core}{an integer value indicating the number of cores to be used by cutadapt 
multicore functionality requires pigz and python3 installed and accessible.}

\item{cutadapt}{a character string specifing the path to the cutadapt executable,
if the executable is in \code{$PATH} then it may be left as default.}

\item{trimgalore}{a character string specifying the path to the trimgalore executable.
On Unix systems, if the executable is in \code{$PATH}, then it may be left as
the default. If it is not in \code{$PATH}, then the absolute path should be given.
unless the system has been set up as described in the vignette.}

This script runs the Trim Galore! tool and requires installation
of both Cutadapt and Trim Galore!  It is essential that Cutadapt is in the
executable path otherwise this tool will not work.
